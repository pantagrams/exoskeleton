# Recitals

Imagine you are in a dark room with music playing from nowhere, mostly seamlessly, with intermittent breaks and surprise chip-ins.
What does music look like? I converted a musical file in python to an image, and it contained black and white very compact lines with no particular pattern. 
I had hoped it would be something nice.
If we conciously forget about the beautiful waveforms we have seen, we start with alternating black and white lines that have no particular pattern as the visual form of music. 
But, we should find something lovelier if we zoom in. Music has a pattern, and several patterns can be harnessed from nature to make music. 
I have loved biology for some of the astonishing patterns in nature it unveils, and recital would allow me to merge the two: music and biology.

Recital is therefore inspired by music playing in a dark room and naturally occuring microarrangements that characterize structures like exoskeletons. 
The foremost fascination about microarrangements is how there can be unique zillions of them within the seemingly confined space of options.  
Sometimes, it's about spacing between elements; other times, it's about angular orientations...Several microchanges yield astonishing patterns.
The second fascination is that these patterns are encoded by switches in genes just like music can be controlled by frequency changes and oscillations.

I used switches and "equalizers" to alternate the patterns. The switches control things like 
the number, thickness, and sparsity of the components of the layers and the continuity of the stack of layers. 
Initially, it felt like the patterns would be repetitive, there would be only a few unique patterns.
But the algorithm yielded surprisingly numerous patterns.

I hope this project makes an impact.

## Traits
### Equalizers
The equalizers are the major regulators of the pattern changes. They are used to introduce randomness in the line thickness, visibility, and layer component sparsity, among others. There are 6 equalizers, and each has a maximum value of 100. There are other minor switches that introduce randomness like the dash property handlers. 

### Centroids
The centroids are used to introduce a sense of mechanical flow that characterizes the production of music. It also creates the feel of a "music player" of some sort,
like a CD player with the CD rotating. The highest number of centroids is 3.
### Cadence
Cadence indicates the seamlessness of the music. Does it flow to the end of the space or does it cut abruptly somewhere in the middle? Each recital can have a "full" or "half" cadence.
### Layers
The layers co-regulate the complexity of each recital. The maximum number of layers is 23.
